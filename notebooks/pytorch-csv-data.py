# # Fed-BioMed Researcher to train a model on a CSV dataset

# This example shows how to use a CSV format file as a node dataset. The example CSV
# file is synthetic data with a format inspired from ADNI dataset.

# ## Start the network
# Before running this notebook, start the network with `./scripts/fedbiomed_run network`
#
## Start the network and setting the node up
# Before running this notebook, you shoud start the network from fedbiomed-network, as detailed in https://gitlab.inria.fr/fedbiomed/fedbiomed-network
# Therefore, it is necessary to previously configure a node:
# 1. `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node add`
#   * Select option 1 to add a csv file to the node
#   * Choose the name, tags and description of the dataset
#     * use `#test_data`` for the tags
#   * Pick the .csv file from your PC (here: pseudo_adni_mod.csv)
#   * Data must have been added
# 2. Check that your data has been added by executing `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node list`
# 3. Run the node using `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node start`. Wait until you get `Starting task manager`. it means you are online.


# ## Create an experiment to train a model on the data found
