    "Fed-BioMed offers a feature to run only the pre-approved models on the nodes. The nodes which receive your model might require approved models. Therefore, if the node accepts only the approved model, the model files that are sent by a researcher with the training request should be approved by the node side in advance. In this workflow, the approval process is done by a real user/person who reviews the code contained in the model file. The reviewer makes sure the model doesn't contain any code that might cause privacy issues or harm the node.\n",

    "## Setting Up a Node\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling model approval can be done both from config file or Fed-BioMed CLI while starting the node. The process of creating and starting a node with model approval option is not so different from setting up a normal node. By default, if no option is specified in the CLI when the node is launched for the first time, the node disables model approval in the security section of the config file. It then looks like the snippet below :\n",

    "```\n",
    "The Fed-BioMed CLI has two optional extra parameters `--enable-model-approval` and `--allow-default-models` to activate model approval. They choose the config file options, when the node is launched for the first time. They enable one-time override of the config file options at each launch of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `--enable-model-approval` : This parameter enables model approval for the node. If there isn't a config file for the node while running CLI, it creates a new config file with enabled model approval mode `model_approval = True`. \n",
    "* `--allow-default-models`  : This parameter allows default models for train requests. These are the models that come for Fed-BioMed tutorials. For example, the model for MNIST dataset that we will be using for this tutorial. If the default models are enabled, node updates/registers model files which are located in `envs/common/default_models` directory during the starting process of the node. This option has no effect if model approval is not enabled.\n",

But it is also possible to start node with `--enable-model-approval`, `--allow-default-models` or `--disable-model-approval`, `--disable-default-models`.
