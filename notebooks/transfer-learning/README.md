This folder contains an example (notebook) of transfer-learning applied on Federated Learning, using the MedNIST dataset on a [densenet model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf), as well as a script that automatically creates configuration files for Nodes.
The example details how to load model weights from [torch hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/), to export them in the model, and train it using Federated Learning.

Instructions on how to use the script can be found either in the notebook or in the help section of the script.torch hub
