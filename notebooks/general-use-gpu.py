# # Fed-BioMed Researcher GPU usage example

# This example demonstrates using a Nvidia GPU for training a model.
# 
# The nodes for this example need to run on a machine providing a Nvidia GPU with enough GPU memory (and from a not-too-old model, so that it is supported by PyTorch).
# 
# If GPU doesn't have enough memory you will get a **out of memory error** at run time.

# ## Start the network
# Before running this notebook, start the network with `./scripts/fedbiomed_run network`
#
# ## Setting the nodes up
# We need at least 1 node, let's test using 3 nodes. For each node, add the MNIST dataset :
# 1. `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config1.ini add`, `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config2.ini add`, `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config3.ini add`
#   * Select option 2 (default) to add MNIST to the node
#   * Confirm default tags by hitting "y" and ENTER
#   * Pick the folder where MNIST is downloaded (this is due torch issue https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/3549)
#   * Data must have been added (if you get a warning saying that data must be unique is because it's been already added)
#   
# 2. Check that your data has been added by executing `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config1.ini list`, `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config2.ini list`, `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config3.ini list`
# 3. Run the first node using `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config1.ini run --gpu` so that the nodes offers GPU for training and uses the default device.
# 4. Run the second node using `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config2.ini run --gpunum 1` so that the nodes offers GPU for training and requests using the 2nd GPU (device 1) but will fallback to default device if you don't have 2 GPUs on this machine.
# 5. Run the third node using `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node config config3.ini run` so that the nodes doesn't offers GPU for training (default behaviour).
# 6. Wait until you get `Starting task manager` for each node, it means you are online.

# ## Define an experiment model and parameters

# Declare a torch.nn MyTrainingPlan class to send for training on the node
