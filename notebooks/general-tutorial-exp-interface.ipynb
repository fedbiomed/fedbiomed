    "The experiment class is the interface and the orchestrator of the whole processes behind federated training on the researcher side. It allows you to manage your federated training experiment easily. It has been extended with setter and getter methods to ease its declaration. This also provides more control before, during or after the training rounds. The purpose of the experiment class is to provide a robust interface for end-user to make them able to easily perform their federated training on Fed-BioMed nodes."
