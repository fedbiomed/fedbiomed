# Use for developing (autoreloads changes made across packages)

# ## Start the network
# Before running this notebook, start the network with `./scripts/fedbiomed_run network`
#
# ## Setting the node up
# It is necessary to previously configure a node:
# 1. `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node add`
#   * Select option 2 (default) to add MNIST to the node
#   * Confirm default tags by hitting "y" and ENTER
#   * Pick the folder where MNIST is downloaded (this is due torch issue https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/3549)
#   * Data must have been added (if you get a warning saying that data must be unique is because it's been already added)
#
# 2. Check that your data has been added by executing `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node add`
# 3. Run the node using `./scripts/fedbiomed_run node add`. Wait until you get `Starting task manager`. it means you are online.
