            sort_by: when specified, sort results by alphabetical order,
                provided sort_by is an entry in the database.
            select_status: filter list by training plan status or list of training plan statuses
            verbose: When it is True, print list of training plan in tabular format.
                Default is True.
            search: Dictionary that contains `text` property to declare the text that wil be search and `by`
                property to declare text will be search on which field

        Returns:
            A list of training plans that have
                been found as `registered`. Each training plan is in fact a dictionary
                containing fields (note that following fields are removed :'training_plan_path',
                'hash', dates due to privacy reasons).
