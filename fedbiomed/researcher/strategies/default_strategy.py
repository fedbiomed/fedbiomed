        Returns:
            weights: Proportions list, each element of this list represents a dictionary with its only key as
                the node_id and its value the proportion of lines the node has with respect to the whole,
            model_params: list with each element representing a dictionary. Its only key represents the node_id
                and the corresponding value is a dictionary containing list of weight matrices of every node : [{"n1":{"layer1":m1,"layer2":m2},{"layer3":"m3"}},{"n2": ...}]
                Including the node_id is useful for the proper functioning of some strategies like Scaffold :
                At each round, local model params are linked to a certain correction. The correction is updated every round.
                The computation of correction states at round i is dependant to client states and correction states of round i-1.
                Since training_replies can potentially order the node replies differently from round to round, the bridge between
                all these parameters is represented by the node_id.
            total_rows: sum of number of samples used by all nodes
            encryption_factors: encryption factors from the participating nodes

        Raises:
            FedbiomedStrategyError: - Miss-matched in answered nodes and existing nodes
                - If not all nodes successfully completes training
