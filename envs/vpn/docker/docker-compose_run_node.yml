  # Minimal configuration for only running a node component from a saved image

  # Minimal dockerfile permits minimal file tree
  # because *all* files dependencies referenced in `docker-compose.yml`
  # (eg: `./*/build_files`, `./*/run_mounts/config/config.env`)
  # need to exist for *all* containers everytime we run a docker-compose command
  # thus we would have to copy file trees for vpnserver, researcher, etc. when only
  # running a node
