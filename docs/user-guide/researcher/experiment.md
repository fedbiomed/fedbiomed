# Experiment Class of Fed-BioMed

## Introduction

Fed-BioMed provides a way to perform Federated Learning, that is a model training process over multiple nodes where the datasets are stored and models get trained. The experiment is in charge of
orchestrating the training process on available nodes. Orchestrating means;

- Searching the datasets on active nodes, based on specific tags given by a researcher and used by the nodes to identify the dataset.
- Uploading the training plan file created by the researcher and sending the file URL to the nodes.
- Sending model and training arguments to the nodes.
- Tracking training process in the nodes during all training rounds.
- Checking the nodes responses to make sure that each round is successfully completed in every node.
- Downloading the local model parameters after every round of training.
- Aggregating the local model parameters based on the specified federated approach, and eventually sending the aggregated parameters to the selected nodes for the next round.
- Optimizing the global model (i.e. the aggregated model).

Please see the following Figure 1 to understand what experiment does after its declaration.

## Defining an experiment

The code snippet below shows a basic experiment initialization for federated training. These arguments have to be passed to the experiment to
tune the experiment based on user preferences.

```python
exp = Experiment(tags=tags,
                 nodes=None,
                 training_plan_class=Net,
                 training_args=training_args,
                 round_limit=rounds,
                 aggregator=FedAverage(),
                 node_selection_strategy=None)

```

!!! note ""
    It is also possible to define an empty experiment and set the arguments afterwards, using the setters of the experiment object.
    Please visit the tutorial [In depth experiment configuration](../../tutorials/advanced/in-depth-experiment-configuration.ipynb) to find out more about
    declaring an experiment step by step

When you first initialize your experiment by providing all the arguments as it is shown in the code snippet above, it creates a `FederatedDataSet` by searching
the datasets in nodes based on the given list of `tags`. Afterwards, it initializes a `Job` object with `training_plan_class`, `training_arguments`,
`model_args`, and the training plan code to manage federated training rounds on all participating nodes. However, it also creates the strategy to select the nodes for each training round.
When the `node_selection_strategy` is set to `None`, the experiment uses the default strategy which is `DefaultStrategy`.

### Looking for a specific dataset using Tags

Nodes can deploy multiple datasets. It means that on each node, each dataset should have a unique dataset id. Since the dataset ids might change from one node to another,
there should be another identifier which will be global for the datasets which are deployed for a specific training plan. This identifier is called "Tags".
Tags allow researchers to select the same dataset registered under a given tag (or list of tags) on each node for the training.

The argument `tags` of the experiment is used for dataset search request. It can be a list of tags which are of type `string` or single tag as of type `string`.
It can be declared at the first definition of experiment or using the setter of the experiment, as illustrated in the code snippet below: in this example, each stanza can be used to retrieve default dataset (tagged using `#MNIST` and `#dataset`).


```python
exp = Experiment()
exp.set_tags(tags=['#MNIST', '#dataset'])
#or
exp.set_tags(tags='#MNIST')
```

You can check your tags in your experiment as follows:

```python
tags = exp.tags()
print(tags)
# > OUTPUT:
# > ['#MNIST', '#dataset']
```

<div class="note-custom">
    <p>
    An <code>Experiment</code> object must have <strong>one unique</strong> dataset per node. Object creation fails if this is not the case when trying to instantiate the <code>FederatedDataSet</code> object. This is done to ensure that training for an <code>Experiment</code> uses only a single dataset for each node.
    </p>
</div>

As a consequence, `tags` specified for an `Experiment` should not be ambiguous, which means they cannot match multiple datasets on one node.

For example if you instantiate `Experiment(tags='#dataset')` and a node has registered one dataset with tags `['#dataset', '#MNIST']` and another dataset with tags `['#dataset', '#foo']` then experiment creation fails.



### Selecting specific Nodes for the training

The argument `nodes` stands for filtering the nodes that are going to be used for federated training. It is useful when there are too many nodes on the network,
and you want to perform federated training on specific ones. `nodes` argument is a list that contains node ids. When it is set, the experiment queries only the nodes that are in the list for a dataset matching tags. You can visit [listing datasets and selecting nodes](./listing-datasets-and-selecting-nodes.md) documentation to get more information about this feature.

```python
nodes = ['node-id-1', 'node-id-2']
exp.set_nodes(nodes=nodes)
```
By default, `nodes` argument is `None` which means that each node that a has registered dataset matching all the tags will be part of the federated training.

```python
exp.set_nodes(nodes=None)
```

!!! note 
        Setting nodes doesn't mean sending another dataset search request to the nodes. If the training data has been already set for the experiment,
        you need to run `exp.set_training_data(training_data=None, from_tags=True)`
        to update <code>FederatedDataset</code> after changing the nodes.
        This command will send search request to specified nodes (to all if `nodes` is `None`) and update training data
        (`FederatedDataset`)




### Load your Training Plan: Training Plan Class and Training Plan Path

The `training_plan_class` is  the class where the model, training data and training step are defined.
Although not required, optimizers and dependencies can also be defined in this class. The experiment will extract
source of your training plan, save as a python module (script), and upload to the file repository during every round of
training. Thanks to that, each node can construct the model and perform the training.


```python
class MyTrainingPlan(TorchTrainingPlan):
    def init_model(self, model_args):
        # Builds the model and returns it
        return model

    def init_optimizer(self, optimizer_args):
        # Builds the optimizer and returns it
        return optimizer

    def training_step(self):
        # Training step at each iteration of training
        return loss

    def training_data(self):
        # Loads the dat and returns Fed-BioMed DataManager
        return DataManager()

exp.set_training_plan_class(training_plan_class=MyTrainingPlan)

# Retrieving training plan class from experiment object
training_plan_class = exp.training_plan_class()

```

There is also another optional argument called `training_plan_path`. This argument can be used when the training plan class is not created
in current python workspace but in a different python script. In such scenarios, `training_plan_path` should indicate the path
where your python script is saved, and the argument `training_plan_class` should be the name of the class that defined in the python
script.


```python
exp.set_training_plan_path(training_plan_path='path/to/your/python/training-plan/script.py')
# Let's assume that class name in `script.py` is `Net` as: `class Net:`
exp.set_training_plan_class(training_plan_class='Net')
```
After setting your training plan path if you haven't set training plan class or name of the training plan class has been changed you need to update/set your training plan class;

### Model Arguments

The `model_args` is a dictionary with the arguments related to the model (e.g. number of layers, layer arguments and dimensions, etc.). This will be passed to the `init_model` method during model setup.
For example, the number of features that are going to be used in network layers can be passed with `model_args`.
An example is shown below.

```python
{
    "in_features"   : 15
    "out_features"  : 1
}
```

These parameters can then be used within a `TrainingPlan` as in the example below,

```python
class MyTrainingPlan(TorchTrainingPlan):

    def init_model(self, model_args):
        model = self.Net(model_args)
        return model

    class Net(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, model_args):
            super().__init__()
            self.in_features = model_args['in_features']
            self.out_features = model_args['out_features']
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(self.in_features, 5)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, self.out_features)

```

!!! warning "Special model arguments for scikit-learn experiments"
    In scikit-learn experiments, you are required to provide additional special arguments in the `model_args`
    dictionary. For classification tasks, you must provide **both** a `n_features` and an `n_classes` field,
    while for regression tasks you are only required to provide a `n_features` field.

    - `n_features`: an integer indicating the number of input features for your model
    - `n_classes`: an integer indicating the number of classes in your task

    Note that, as an additional requirement for classification tasks, **classes must be identified by integers
    in the range `0..n_classes`**

### Training Arguments

`training_args` is a dictionary, containing the arguments for the training on the node side (e.g. data loader arguments,
optimizer arguments, epochs, etc.). These arguments are *dynamic*, in the sense that you may change them between two
rounds of the same experiment, and the updated changes will be taken into account (provided you also update the 
experiment using the `set_training_args` method).

A list of valid arguments is given in the [TrainingArgs.default_scheme][fedbiomed.common.training_args.TrainingArgs.default_scheme]
documentation.

To set the training arguments you may either pass them to the `Experiment` constructor, or set
them on an instance with the `set_training_arguments` method:

```python
exp.set_training_arguments(training_args=training_args)
```
To get the current training arguments that are used for the experiment, you can write:

```python
exp.training_args()
```

#### Controlling the number of training loop iterations
The preferred way is to set the `num_updates` training argument. This argument is equal to the number of iterations
to be performed in the training loop. In mini-batch based scenarios, this corresponds to the number of updates
to the model parameters, hence the name. In PyTorch notation, this is equivalent to the number of calls to 
`optimizer.step`.

Another way to determine the number of training loop iterations is to set `epochs` in the training arguments. In this
case, you may optionally set a `batch_maxnum` argument, in order to exit the training loop before a full epoch is
completed. If `batch_maxnum` is set and is greater than 0, then only `batch_maxnum` iterations will be performed per 
epoch.

!!! warning "`num_updates` is the same for all nodes"
    If you specify `num_updates` in your `training_args`, then every node will perform the same number of updates.
    Conversely, if you specify `epochs`, then each node may perform a different number of iterations if their
    local dataset sizes differ.

Note that if you set both `num_updates` and `epochs` by mistake, the value of `num_updates` takes precedence, and 
`epochs` will effectively be ignored. 

!!! info "Why num updates?"
    In a federated scenario, different nodes may have datasets with very different sizes. By performing the same number
    of epochs on each node, we would be biasing the global model towards the larger nodes, because we would be
    performing more gradient updates based on their data. Instead, we fix the number of gradient updates regardless of
    the dataset size with the `num_updates` parameter.

##### Compatibility

Not all configurations are compatible with all types of aggregators and experiments. 
We list here the known constraints: 

- the [Scaffold](../../user-guide/researcher/aggregation.md#scaffold) aggregator **requires** using `num_updates`

#### Batch size and other data loader arguments

!!! info "Dataloader arguments are automatically injected through the `DataManager` class"
    It is strongly recommended to always provide a `loader_args` key in your training arguments, with a dictionary
    as value containing at least the `batch_size` key.

Example of minimal loader arguments:
```python
training_args = {
    'loader_args': {
        'batch_size': 1
    }
}
```

Note that the `loader_arguments`, as well as any additional keyword arguments that you will specify in your 
`DataManager` constructor, will be automatically injected in the definition of the data loader. 
Please refer to the [`training_data`](../../user-guide/researcher/training-data.md) method 
documentation for more details.

#### Setting a random seed for reproducibility

The `random_seed` argument allows to set a random seed at the beginning of each round. 

!!! info "`random_seed` is set both on the node and the researcher"
    The `random_seed` is set whenever the `TrainingPlan` is instantiated: both on the researcher side before sending 
    the train command for a new round, and on the node side at the beginning of the configuration of the new training 
    round.

Setting the `random_seed` affects:

- the random initialization of model parameters at the beginning of the experiment
- the random shuffling of data in the `DataLoader`
- any other random effect on the node and researcher side.

The same seed is used for the built-in `random` module, `numpy.random` and `torch.random`, effectively equivalent to:
```python
import random
import numpy as np
import torch

random.seed(training_args['random_seed'])
np.random.seed(training_args['random_seed'])
torch.manual_seed(training_args['random_seed'])
```

!!! warning "`random_seed` is reset at every round"
    The random_seed argument will be reset to the specified value at the beginning of every round.

Because of this, the same sequence will be used for random effects like shuffling the dataset for all the rounds within
an `exp.run()` execution. This is not what the user typically wants. A simple workaround is to manually change the seed
at every round and use `exp.run_once` instead:

```python
for i in range(num_rounds):
    training_args['random_seed'] = 42 + i
    exp.set_training_args(training_args)
    exp.run_once()
```

#### Sub-arguments for optimizer and differential privacy

In Pytorch experiments, you may include sub arguments such as `optimizer_args` 
and `dp_args`. Optimizer arguments represents the arguments that are going to be passed to
`def init_optimizer(self, o_args)` method as dictionary and (`dp_args`) represents the arguments 
of [differential privacy](../../tutorials/security/non-private-local-central-dp-monai-2d-image-registration.ipynb).

<div class="note">
    <p>
        Optimizer arguments and differential privacy arguments are valid only in PyTorch base training plan.
    </p>
</div>

```python
training_args = {
    'batch_size': 20,
    'num_updates': 100,
    'optimizer_args': {
        'lr': 1e-3,
    },
    'dp_args': {
        'type': 'local',
        'sigma': 0.4,
        'clip': 0.005
    },
    'dry_run': False,
}
```
### Aggregator

An aggregator is one of the required arguments for the experiment. It is used on the researcher for aggregating model parameters that are received from the nodes after
every round. By default, when the experiment is initialized without passing any aggregator, it will automatically use the default `FedAverage`
aggregator class. However, it is also possible to set a different aggregation algorithm with the method `set_aggregator`. Currently, Fed-BioMed has
only `FedAverage` and `Scaffold` classes, but it is possible to create a custom aggregator class. You can see the current aggregator by running `exp.aggregator()`.
It will return the aggregator object that will be used for aggregation.

When you pass the aggregator argument as `None` it will use `FedAverage` aggregator (performing a Federated Averaging aggregation) by default.

```python
exp.set_aggregator(aggregator=None)
```

or you can directly pass an aggregator class

```python
from fedbiomed.researcher.aggregators.fedavg import FedAverage
exp.set_aggregator(aggregator=FedAverage)
```

!!! info ""
    Custom aggregator classes should inherit from the base class <code>Aggregator</code> of Fed-BioMed. Please visit user guide for  [aggregators](./aggregation.md) for more information.

!!! info "About Scaffold Aggregator"
    `FedAverage` reflects only how local models sent back by `Nodes` are aggregated, whereas `Scaffold` also implement additional elements such as the `Optimizer` on `Researcher` side. Please note that currently only `FedAverage` is compatible with [`declearn`'s `Optimizers`](../../advanced-optimization).

### Node Selection Strategy
Node selection Strategy is also one of the required arguments for the experiment. It is used for selecting nodes before each round of training. Since the strategy will be used for selecting nodes, thus, training data should be already set before setting any strategies. Then, strategy will be able to select among training nodes that are currently available regarding their dataset.

By default, `set_strategy(node_selection_strategy=None)` will use the default `DefaultStrategy` strategy. It is the default strategy in Fed-BioMed that selects for the training all the nodes available regardless their datasets. However, it is also possible to set different strategies. Currently, Fed-BioMed only provides `DefaultStrategy` but you can create your custom strategy classes.

### Round Limit

The experiment should have a round limit that specifies the max number of training round. By default, it is `None`, and it needs to be created either
declaring/building experiment class or using setter method for round limit. Setting round limit doesn't mean that it is going to be permanent. It can be
changed after running the experiment once or more.

```python
exp.set_round_limit(round_limit=4)
```

To see current round limit of the experiment:

```python
exp.round_limit()
```

You might also wonder how many rounds have been completed in the experiment. The method `round_current()` will return the last round that has been
completed.

```python
exp.round_currrent()
```

### Displaying training loss values through Tensorboard

The argument `tensorboard` is of type boolean, and it is used for activating tensorboard during the training. When it is `True` the loss values
received from each node will be written into tensorboard event files in order to display training loss function on the tensorboard interface.

Tensorboard events are controlled by the class called `Monitor`. To enable tensorboard after the experiment has already been initialized, you can
use the method `set_monitor()` of the experiment object.

```python
exp.set_monitor(tensorboard=True)
```

You can visit [tensorboard documentation](./tensorboard.md) page to get more information about how to use tensorboard with Fed-BioMed

### Saving Breakpoints

Breakpoint is a researcher side function that saves an intermediate status and training results of an experiment to disk files.
The argument `save_breakpoints` is of type boolean, and it indicates whether breakpoints of the experiment should be saved after each round of
training or not. `save_breakpoints` can be declared while creating the experiment or after using its setter method.

```python
exp.set_save_breakpoints(True)
```

!!! info
        Setting `save_breakpoints` to `True` after the experiment has performed several rounds of
        training will only save the breakpoints for remaining rounds.


Please visit the tutorial ["Breakpoints (experiment saving facility)"](../../tutorials/advanced/breakpoints.md) to find out more about breakpoints.

### Experimentation Folder

Experimentation folder indicates the name of the folder in which all the experiment results will be stored/saved. By default,
it will be `Experiment_XXXX`, and `XXXX` part stands for the auto increment (hence, first folder will be named `Experiment_0001`, the second one `Experiment_0002` and so on). However, you can also define your custom
experimentation folder name.

Passing experimentation folder while creating the experiment;
```python
exp = Experiment(
    #....
    experimentation_folder='MyExperiment'
    #...
)
```

Setting experimentation folder using setter;
```python
exp.set_experimentation_folder(experimentation_folder='MyExperiment')
```

Using custom folder name for your experimentation might be useful for identifying different types of experiment. Experiment folders will be
located at `${FEDBIOMED_DIR}/var/experiments`. However, you can always get exact path to your experiment folder using the getter method
`experimentation_path()`. Below is presented a way to retrieve all the files from the folder using `os` builtin package.

```python
import os

exp_path = exp.experimentation_path()
os.listdir(exp_path)
```

## Running an Experiment

### `train_request` and `train_reply` messages

Running an experiment means starting the training process by sending train request to nodes. It publishes training
commands as JSON string on the MQTT topics (separate topics for each node) that are subscribed by each live node. After
sending training commands it waits for the responses that will be sent by the nodes. The following code snippet represents
an example of train request.

```json
{
  "researcher_id": "researcher id that sends training command",
  "job_id": "created job id by experiment",
  "training_args": {
    "batch_size": 32,
    "optimizer_args": {
      "lr": 0.001
    },
    "epochs": 1,
    "dry_run": false,
    "batch_maxnum": 100
  },
  "model_args": <args>,
  "command": "train",
  "training_plan_url": "<training plan url>",
  "params_url": "<model_parameter_url>",
  "training_plan_class": "Net",
  "training_data": {
    "node_id": [
      "dataset_id"
    ]
  }
}
```

After sending train requests, Experiment waits for the replies that are going to be published by each node once every round of training is completed.
These replies are called training replies, and they include information about the training and the URL from which to download
model parameters that have been uploaded by the nodes to the file repository. The following code snippet shows
an example of `training_reply` from a node.

```python
{
   "researcher_id":"researcher id that sends the training command",
   "job_id":"job id that creates training job",
   "success":True,
   "node_id":"ID of the node that completes the training ",
   "dataset_id":"dataset_dcf88a68-7f66-4b60-9b65-db09c6d970ee",
   "params_url":"URL of the model parameters' file obtained after training",
   "timing":{
      "rtime_training":87.74385611899197,
      "ptime_training":330.388954968
   },
   "msg":"",
   "command":"train"
}

```
`training_reply` always results of a `training_request` sent by the `Researcher` to the `Node`.

To complete one round of training, the experiment waits until receiving each reply from nodes. At the end of the round,
it downloads the model parameters that are indicated in the training replies. It aggregates the model parameters
based on a given aggregation class/algorithm. This process is repeated until every round is completed. Please see Figure 1
to understand how federated training is performed between the nodes and the Researcher (`Experiment`) component.

exchanged between `Researcher` and 2 `Nodes` during a Federated Training*


### The Methods `run()`and `run_once()`

In order to provide more control over the training rounds, `Experiment` class has two methods as `run` and `run_once`
to run training rounds.

 - `run()` runs the experiment rounds from current round to round limit. If the round limit is reached it will indicate
that the round limit has been reached. However, the method `run` takes 2 arguments as `rounds` and `increase`.
    - `rounds` is an integer that indicates number of rounds that are going to be run. If the experiment is at round `0`,
     the round limit is `4`, and if you pass `rounds` as 3, it will run the experiment only for `3` rounds.
    - `increase` is a boolean that indicates whether round limit should be increased if the given `rounds` pass over the
 round limit. For example, if the current round is `3`, the round limit is `4`, and the `rounds` argument is `2`, the experiment will increase round limit to `5`
 - `run_once()` runs the experiment for single round of training. If the round limit is reached it will indicate that
the round limit has been reached. This command is the same as `run(rounds=1, increase=False)`. However, if `run_once` is executed as `run_once(increase=True)`, then, when the round limit is reached, it increases the round limit for one extra round.

To run your experiment until the round limit;

```python
exp.run()
```

To run your experiment for given number of rounds (while not passing the round limit):

```python
exp.run(rounds=2)
```

To run your experiment for given number of rounds and increase the round limit accordingly if needed:

```python
exp.run(rounds=2, increase=True)
```

To run your experiment only once (while not passing the round limit):

```python
exp.run_once()
```

To run your experiment only once even round limit is reached (and increase the round limit accordingly if needed):

```python
exp.run_once(increase=True)
```

!!! info ""
    Running experiment with both `run(rounds=rounds, increase=True)` and `run_once(increase=True)` will
    automatically increase/update round limit if it is exceeded.
