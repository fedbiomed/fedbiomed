# Versions

Fed-BioMed stores and checks version numbers for several of its components. 
The [semantics of the versions](https://semver.org/) are as follows:

- different **major** version: incompatibility that results in halting the execution immediately
- different **minor** or **micro** version: backward compatibility, provide a warning message if versions are different

This page tracks the version changes for each component, to provide further information when incompatibilities are
detected.

## Messaging protocol

Note that due to the two-sided nature of the communication, every change to the messaging protocol
is equivalent to a major change.

!!! warning "Incompatible versions"
    In case of version mismatch, the only solution is to upgrade the software to have the same version on researcher
    and all nodes.
