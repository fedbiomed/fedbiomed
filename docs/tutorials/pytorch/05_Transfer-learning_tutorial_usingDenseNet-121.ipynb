    "## Transfer-learning\n",
    "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed or adapted for a second related task. Transfer learning uses a pre-trained neural network on a large dataset, as [Imagenet](https://www.image-net.org) is used to train DenseNet model to perform classification of a wide diversity of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is that the knowledge gained from learning one task can be useful for learning another task (as we do here, the knowledge of DenseNet model trained on ImageNet is used to classify medical images in 6 categories). This is particularly beneficial when the amount of labeled data for the target task is limited, as the pre-trained model has already learned useful features and representations from a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is typically applied in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (I) Feature Extraction: In this approach, the pre-trained model is used as a fixed feature extractor. The earlier layers of the neural network, which capture general features and patterns, are frozen, and only the later layers are replaced or retrained for the new task. \n",
    "\n",
    "- (II) Fine-tuning: In this approach, the pre-trained model is further trained or partially trained on the new task. This allows the model to adapt its learned representations to the specifics of the new task while retaining some of the knowledge gained from the original task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we load on two nodes a sampled dataset ( 500 images and 1000 images) of MedNIST to illustrate   transfer-learning's effectiveness. The sampled dataset is made with a random selection of images and return a sampled dataset with balanced classes, to avoid classification's bias.\n",
    "We will run two independant TrainingPlan experiments, one without transfer-learning and the second with transfer learning.\n",
    "We will compare these two experiments running on DenseNet model with focus on loss value and accuracy as metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of Transfer-learning methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Nota**: This Transfer-Learning example is not to be confused with *Federated Transfer Learning-FTL* (see for example [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04885)). The example only showcases here Transfer Learning on a Feerated Learning use case."
