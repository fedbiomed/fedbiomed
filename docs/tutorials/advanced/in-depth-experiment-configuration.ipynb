    "The Experiment class provides an interface that you can manage your experiment with backward compatibility. It means that even if your Experiment has been built/defined you will be able to configure its parameters, and allow you to run your notebooks created using previous Fed-BioMed versions (<3.4). This feature will provide more control over your experiment even after you have been running your experiment for several rounds. In this tutorial, the experiment interface will be explained using MNIST basic example."

    "The `Experiment` class is the interface and the orchestrator of the whole processes behind federated training on the researcher side. It allows you to manage your federated training experiment easily. It has been extended with setter and getter methods to ease its declaration. This also provides more control before, during or after the training rounds. The purpose of the experiment class is to provide a robust interface for end-user to make them able to easily perform their federated training on Fed-BioMed nodes."
