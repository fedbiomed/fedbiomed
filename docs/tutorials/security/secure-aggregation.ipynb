    "### Configuring/Installing Element for Secure Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Fed-BioMed provides two secure aggregation schemes: LOM and Joye-Libert. While LOM doesn't require configuration or extra installation. Joye-Libert depends on third-party modules and certificate configuration after a basic installation of Fed-BioMed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow the detailed instructions for configuring [Fed-BioMed instance for secure aggregation](../../../user-guide/secagg/configuration.md) or apply following shortened instructions for a basic setup for Joye-Libert. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create node and researcher instances\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.1 Create nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "It is mandatory to have at least two nodes for the experiment that requires secure aggregation. Please execute following commands to create two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node 1:\n",

    "##### 1.2 Create researcher\n",
    "\n",
    "Please run the command below to create researcher component.\n",

    "\n",
    "Please follow these instructions if you activate Joye-Libert secure aggregation:\n",
    "Joye-Libert configuration requires to know the participating Fed-BioMed components in advance. Therefore, each component that will participate in the training should be created before starting them. Afterwards, participating components can be registered in every other component.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Add dataset and start nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step will be adding/deploying MNIST dataset in the nodes and starting them. For this step you can follow the instructions for [adding dataset](../../../user-guide/nodes/deploying-datasets) into nodes to add MNIST dataset. After the datasets are deployed you can start the nodes and researcher.\n",

    "#####  3.1 Install and configure\n",
    "\n",
    "Fed-BioMed uses [MP-SPDZ](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ) for MPC that is needed for Joye-Libert. Therefore, please make sure that MP-SPDZ are installed and configured for Fed-BioMed by running following command.\n",

    "\n",
    "Normally, as it is mentioned in [secure aggregation configuration](../../../user-guide/secagg/configuration) each participating instance should register network credentials of others such as IP, port and SSL certificate. however, since this example will be run on single clone of Fed-BioMed, registration process can be done automaticity by running following command.\n",
