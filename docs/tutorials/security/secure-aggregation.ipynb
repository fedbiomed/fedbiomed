    "Secure aggregation is one of the security feature that is provided by Fed-BioMed. Please refer to [secure aggregation user guide](../../../user-guide/secagg/introduction) for more information regarding the methods and techniques that are used. This tutorial gives an example of secure aggregation usage in Fed-BioMed."

    "## Setting up the nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "During the tutorial, nodes and researcher will be launched locally using single clone of Fed-BioMed. However, it is also possible to execute notebook cells when the components are configured remotely by respecting following instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start the network\n",
    "Before running this notebook, start the network with `./scripts/fedbiomed_run network`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring/Installing  Element for Secure Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow the detailed instructions for configuring [Fed-BioMed instance for secure aggregation](../../../user-guide/secagg/configuration) or apply following shortened instructions for a basic setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install and configure\n",
    "\n",
    "Fed-BioMed uses MP-SPDZ for MPC. Therefore, please make sure that MP-SPDZ are installed and configured for Fed-BioMed by running following command.\n",

    "    <p>Since node and researcher will be run in the same machine, single configuration for MP-SDPZ will enouhg</>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create node and researcher instances\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup for secure aggregation requires knowledge of the participating Fed-BioMed components in advance. Therefore, each component that will participate in the training should be created before starting them. Afterwards, participating components can be registered in every other component.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1\n",
    "It is mandatory to have at least two nodes for the experiment that requires secure aggregation. Please execute following commands to create two nodes.\n",

    "#### 3. Registering participating Fed-BioMed instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, as it is mentioned in [secure aggregation configuration](../../../user-guide/secagg/configuration) each participating instance should register network credentials of others such as IP, port and SSL certificate. however, since this example will be run on single clone of Fed-BioMed, registration process can be done automaticity by running following command.\n",

    "The next step will be adding/deploying MNIST dataset in the nodes and starting them. For these step you can follow the instructions for [adding dataset](../../../user-guide/nodes/deploying-datasets) into nodes to add MNIST dataset. After the datasets are deployed you can start the nodes and researcher."
