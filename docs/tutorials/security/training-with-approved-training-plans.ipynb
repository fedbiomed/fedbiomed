    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fed-BioMed offers a feature to run only the pre-approved training plans on the nodes by default. The nodes which receive your training plan might require approved training plans. Therefore, if the node accepts only the approved training plan, the training plan files that are sent by a researcher with the training request should be approved by the node side in advance. In this workflow, the training plan approval process is done by a real user/person who reviews the code contained in the training plan file/class. The reviewer makes sure the model doesn't contain any code that might cause privacy issues or harm the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be creating a node with activated training plan control option.  "

    "## Setting Up a Node\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling training plan control can be done both from config file or Fed-BioMed CLI while starting the node. The process of creating and starting a node with training plan control option is not so different from setting up a normal node. By default, if no option is specified in the CLI when the node is launched for the first time, the node disables training plan control in the security section of the config file. It then looks like the snippet below :\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "[security]\n",
    "hashing_algorithm = SHA256\n",
    "allow_default_training_plans = True\n",
    "training_plan_approval = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is also possible to manage training plan approval mode using environment variables. `FBM_SECURITY_TRAINING_PLAN_APPROVAL=True` and `FBM_SECURITY_ALLOW_DEFAULT_TRAINING_PLANS=True` to activate training plan approval mode. They enable one-time override of the config file options at each launch of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `FBM_SECURITY_TRAINING_PLAN_APPROVAL=True` : This variable enables training plan control for the node. If there isn't a config file for the node while running CLI, it creates a new config file with enabled training plan approval mode `training_plan_approval = True`. \n",
    "* `FBM_SECURITY_ALLOW_DEFAULT_TRAINING_PLANS=True`  : This variable allows default training plans for train requests. These are the training plans that come for Fed-BioMed tutorials. For example, the training plan for MNIST dataset that we will be using for this tutorial. If the default training plans are enabled, node updates/registers training plan files which are located in `envs/common/default_training_plans` directory during the starting process of the node. This option has no effect if training plan control is not enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding MNIST Dataset to The Node. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will add MNIST dataset to the node. While adding the dataset through CLI we'll also specify `FBM_SECURITY_TRAINING_PLAN_APPROVAL=True` and `FBM_SECURITY_ALLOW_DEFAULT_TRAINING_PLANS=True` options. This will create new `config-n1.ini` file with following configuration. \n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI will ask you to select the dataset type. Since we will be working on MNIST dataset, please select `2` (default) and continue by typing `y` for the next prompt and select folder that you want to store MNIST dataset. Afterward, if you go to `etc` directory of fedbiomed, you can see `config-n1.ini` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting the Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start your node by running following command; \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ ${FEDBIOMED_DIR}/scripts/fedbiomed_run node --config config-n1.ini start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since config file has been configured to enable training plan control mode, you do not need to specify any extra parameter while starting the node. But it is also possible to start node with `FBM_SECURITY_TRAINING_PLAN_APPROVAL=True`, `FBM_SECURITY_ALLOW_DEFAULT_TRAINING_PLANS=True` or `FBM_SECURITY_TRAINING_PLAN_APPROVAL=False`, `FBM_SECURITY_ALLOW_DEFAULT_TRAINING_PLANS=False`. If you start your node with `FBM_SECURITY_TRAINING_PLAN_APPROVAL=False` it will disable training plan control even it is enabled in the config file.  \n"
