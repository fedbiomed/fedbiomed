We are proud to announce the successful deployment and testing of Fed-BioMed into the Hospital Antoine Lacassagne (CAL) of Nice!
CAL is the first partner among the network of oncology centers of the UNICANCER consortium, in which Fed-BioMed is providing a secured federated learning infrastructure for IA in healthcare. A big thanks to Olivier Humbert and Hamid Laceb of CAL, and to the Fed-BioMed team!
